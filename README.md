 # Running pace/speed/time/distance conversion chart.

### The quick way to see how fast you run in kilometres and miles.

My Garmin Fenix 6 Sapphire is my personal interface and on-board 'dashboard' of choice, yielding the myriad physiological telemetry, metrics *and* environmental data I require to 'fuzzily' estimate pace/distance and finishing time during a run.

However, if I plan on beating a PR (particularly on a familiar route) I like to pre-calculate pace, speed and distance more accurately. [This simple chart](http://wachilt.github.io/running-pace-conversion-chart/) allows me to quickly do just that.
