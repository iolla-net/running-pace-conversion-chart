### The quick and easy way to see how fast you run in kilometres and miles.

**[Running Pace Conversion Chart](http://wachilt.github.io/running-pace-conversion-chart/)**

A Garmin fÄ“nix 6 Sapphire is my personal interface and 'on-board' dashboard of choice. It's sensor array yields the myriad physiological metrics, telemetry *and* local environmental data I require to '*fuzzily*' estimate net pace and predicted finish time during a run.

However, I like to 'preflight' speed, distance and time more accurately when aiming for a PR, particularly when running a route I am familiar with. This simple static **[chart](http://wachilt.github.io/running-pace-conversion-chart/)** allows me to do just that.
