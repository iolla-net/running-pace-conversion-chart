# Running pace/speed/time/distance conversion chart

### The quick way to see how fast you run in km and miles

[Running Pace Conversion Chart](http://wachilt.github.io//running-pace-conversion-chart/)

My Garmin Fenix 6 Sapphire is my personal running 'dashboard', yielding all the physiological *and* environmental telemetry I require to 'fuzzily' estimate pace/distance and finishing time during a run 

However, I often like to calculate pace, speed and distance more accurately, particularly if I'm looking to beat a PR on a familiar route. This simple chart allows me to quickly do just that.
