My Garmin fÄ“nix 6 Sapphire is my personal interface and 'on-board' dashboard of choice. It's sensor array yields the myriad physiological telemetry, metrics *and* local environmental data I require to '*fuzzily*' estimate pace and finishing time during a run.

However, whenever I set out to beat a PR (particularly on a familiar route) I like to 'preflight' speed, distance and time more accurately in order to do so. [This simple static chart](http://wachilt.github.io/running-pace-conversion-chart/) allows me to quickly do just that.
