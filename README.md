My Garmin fÄ“nix 6 Sapphire is my personal 'on-board' interface and dashboard of choice. It's sensor array yields the myriad physiological telemetry, metrics *and* local environmental data I require to '*fuzzily*' estimate net pace and predicted finishing time during a run.

However, I like to 'preflight' speed, distance and time more accurately when aiming for a PR, particularly when running a route I am familiar with. [This simple static chart](http://wachilt.github.io/running-pace-conversion-chart/) allows me to do just that.
