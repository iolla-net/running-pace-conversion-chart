 # Running pace/speed/time/distance conversion chart

### The quick way to see how fast you run in kilometres and miles

**[Running Pace Conversion Chart](http://wachilt.github.io/running-pace-conversion-chart/)**

My Garmin Fenix 6 Sapphire is my personal, on-board 'dashboard', yielding all the physiological telemetry *and* environmental data I require to 'fuzzily' estimate pace/distance and finishing time during a run.

However, I often like to calculate pace, speed and distance more accurately, particularly if I'm looking to beat a PR on a familiar route. This simple chart allows me to quickly do just that.
